Bluedot Point SDK iOS v1.6 Release Notes
----------------------------------------

- New feature:  Check out from a fence or beacon.
                
        The delegate methods for checking-in have been updated to:

            - (void)didCheckIntoFence:inZone:atCoordinate:onDate:willCheckOut:
            - (void)didCheckIntoBeacon:inZone:withProximity:onDate:willCheckOut:

        There are two new delegate methods for notification of checking out:

            - (void)didCheckOutFromFence:inZone:onDate:withDuration:
            - (void)didCheckOutFromBeacon:inZone:withProximity:onDate:withDuration:


- Note:  The previous didCheckInto... methods have been deprecated and will be removed in a future version.

        - (void)didCheckIntoFence:inZone:atCoordinate:onDate:  (Deprecated)
        - (void)didCheckIntoBeacon:inZone:withProximity:onDate:  (Deprecated)


- Note:  The Minimum Re-trigger Time for a fence or beacon within any zone configured for Check Out is now initiated upon checking out of a fence or beacon.
