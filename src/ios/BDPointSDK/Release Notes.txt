Bluedot Point SDK iOS v1.5 Release Notes
----------------------------------------

- New feature:  The 'InstallRef', a unique UUID for a specific App installation, is now revealed through BDLocationManager.
                This was previously shown only in each Zone's 'Activity Log', in Point Access, and made available via the Public API.
                Revealing this on the client as well as the back-end provides App Developers with the opportunity to more easily implement App behaviours based on Check-In history. 

- Enhancement:  Point SDK is now compatible with Swift 2.1.

- Enhancement:  A speed field has now been added to the BDLocation object.

- Bug fix:      Fixed an issue with the 'Custom Action' callback in BDPLocationDelegate:
                When a Zone consisting of multiple Fences was triggered, the specific Fence nominated as causing the trigger was occasionally incorrect.
                This has been fixed and thoroughly re-tested.

- Bug fix:      Fixed an issue where Date-range Conditions could be inaccurate by several hours depending on the device's Time-Zone.
                Date-range Conditions are now always fixed to the device's Time-Zone.

- Bug fix:	 Sometimes a trigger would not occur if a the Point SDK session was started while already inside a geofence.  This has now been corrected.

- Bug fix:	 If Session and Location delegate assignment was made immediately after calling the BDLocationManager authentication method (and not before as prescribed in the 			 documentation) then the calling thread could be deadlocked.  This has now been fixed.
